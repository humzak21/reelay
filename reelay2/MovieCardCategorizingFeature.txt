COMPLETE: Year highlighting

In @MoviesView.swift highlight the release year in Cyan with a slight
subtle glow when the film entry is logged in the same year as it was released.
Eg: If I watched Deadpool & Wolverine in 2024, the "2024" under the title should
be cyan with the subtle glow. 

COMPLETE: Must Watches highlighting
In @MoviesView.swift highlight the title of the film in purple with a subtle glow similar
to the year highlighting feature when the film entry is 1. on the must watches list for that year.
and 2. logged in that respective year for that must watches list.
Example: Say Interstellar is in the list "Must Watches for 2024" (all must watches list have the same title format),
and I log Interstellar in 2024. Every time Interstellar is logged in 2024 it should get this purple formatting. 

TODO: Highlighting every 100th film.
I want to highlight everytime I hit a 100th milestone, but I want two separate versions.
One for every 100th unique film entry (only one of each film title), and one for every 100th log (every entry included no exceptions).
The unique film highlighting will change the entire film card in @MoviesView from white/grey (light/dark mode) to a yellow gradient with an orange glow around it. Something that screams first place trophy.
The every 100th log highlighting will change the entire film card in @MoviesView from white/grey to a red gradient with an orange glow around it.
